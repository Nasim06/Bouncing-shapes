# Bouncing-shapes

Coursework from my year 1 object oriented programming module 

A window that loads in shapes with velocity that will bounce of the edges

The programme asks for a shape file then reads the information from the shape file 
(shape, size, colour, position, velocity) then loads the shape based on the information
